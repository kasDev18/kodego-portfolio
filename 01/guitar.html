                <h6 class="text-light">Learning to play a guitar My passion for playing guitar directed me to consider the words of Abraham Lincoln that "Nothing in this world is impossible to a willing heart".  This were very important wise words that kept resonating in my heart and mind as I looked in to the negative comments that were likely to deviate my aspirations of learning how to play a guitar. When I reflect back in my achievements as well as my past life, I appreciate the contribution of perseverance and commitment in the efforts of pursuing my dreams of playing a guitar professionally. </h6>
